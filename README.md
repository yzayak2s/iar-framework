# *Integration Architectures* MEAN-Template

This template is meant to support students getting started with the Integration Architectures project.

## Prerequisites
 1. You need a **Node.js** runtime. It is available at: https://nodejs.org/ .
    
    [![NodeJs Website](readme_resources/node.png)](https://nodejs.org/)
    Please download a version >14.x.x (The current LTS version 14.18.x works, but also the newest version 16.11.x should
    be fine).
 
    __!!! Important: On Windows (and maybe also other operating systems) it is necessary to reboot the device after this
    step, to refresh the PATH and make `node` commands available in shell.__


 2. Access to a **MongoDB** server is necessary. If you don't have one already, you should download the community server at:
    https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community .
    [![MongoDB Website](readme_resources/mongodb.png)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
    Upon installation, I would recommend you to select, that MongoDB
    Compass should also be installed. It's a nice GUI-application for managing MongoDB Servers and Databases.

## Setup
You can use your favourite IDE to work on your applications. But please note, that our examples mostly cover the IDEs from 
Jetbrains (IntelliJ, WebStorm etc.).

 1. **Cloning this git repository**

    You need to clone this repository. It can simply be done through your IDE or using git bash.
    
    ![IntelliJ git clone](readme_resources/new_from_version_control.png)
    In the IDEs from Jetbrains git repositories can be cloned by selecting *File > New > Project from Version Control* (Shown on the left of the screenshot).
    Also, there is a "Get from VCS" button on the welcome-screen, when no project is opened.
    Either way a dialog is displayed (shown on the right), where you can paste the URL and clone it.
 <br><br>
    Alternatively git bash can be used. Simply type/paste this at the desired location:

    `git clone https://github.com/LUC4R4T0R/Integration-Architectures-MEAN-Template`


 2. **Installing dependencies**

    The dependencies of this software can be installed with node package manager (npm). Both front- and backend need to be
    handled separately.<br>
    
    ![npm install in InteliJ](readme_resources/npm_backend.png)
    In IntelliJ and Webstorm you can just right-click the `package.json` file and select "Run 'npm install'" to install
    the dependencies.<br> Alternatively you navigate to the location of the `package.json` inside your shell and then run `npm install`.
    <br><br>
    __Either way, this has to be done both in the directory `frontend/` and `backend/`.__

## Launching the Applications

For both front- and backend there ar run scripts included in their `package.json`.
So you can just start them by running `npm run start` in their respective directories.

After they are done starting, the frontend can be reached from your browser at: http://localhost:4200/
[![Login page of template](readme_resources/login.png)](http://localhost:4200/)
You can log in with username *admin* and the password, which is printed out to the console output of the backend.
<br>**!!! Attention: The password will only be printed out on first startup (e.g. when no user is present in the database).<br>So please write it down!**
